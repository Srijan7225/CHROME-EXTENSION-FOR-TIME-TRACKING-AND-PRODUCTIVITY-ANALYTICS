*DESCRIPTION*:

This project is about building a Chrome Extension that helps users track the time they spend on different websites and gives them useful insights into their online habits. The goal is to make people more productive by showing them where their time goes and helping them control distractions.

#How It Works:
1. Chrome Extension: Runs in the browser, tracks active tabs, and records how much time is spent.
2. Backend Server (Node.js + MongoDB):
*Stores user data like websites visited, time spent, and classification.
*Handles authentication (signup/login).
*Generates productivity stats.

3. Dashboard (React.js):
*Displays graphs, charts, and weekly summaries.
*Lets users mark websites as productive or unproductive.
*Provides tips for better time management.

#Key Features:

1. Automatic Website Tracking – no need to manually start or stop timers.
2. Productivity Classification – separates productive and unproductive websites.
3. User Accounts – secure login system with JWT authentication.
4. Analytics Dashboard – clean and simple UI showing:
   *Total time spent online.
   *Daily/weekly usage trends.
   *Most visited websites.
5. Weekly Reports – easy to read reports sent automatically.
